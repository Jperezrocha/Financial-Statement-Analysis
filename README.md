I developed a Python-based financial analysis project to extract, analyze, and model financial data using the Finance Modeling Prep API. This project allows me to assess the health of companies by analyzing their income statements, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows. Furthermore, I utilized the Pandas library to efficiently process and manage financial information, while Matplotlib was employed to create informative visualizations depicting company performance over time. In the future, I plan to extend the project's capabilities by implementing statistical predictions using Scipy and incorporating machine learning with Scikit-learn.
